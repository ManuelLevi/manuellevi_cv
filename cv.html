                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Born in the university city of Coimbra, my family bought our first computer when I was 9 yrs old.
                        This computer was slow and internet access was scarce. This meant, that unlike most of my
                        friends, I
                        wouldn't spend any time playing games or browsing the 90's internet. Instead, I found fun in
                        programming scripts and my own games as a kid.</p>
                    <p>Today, I am a data scientist with experience working with +8 figure companies and market leaders
                        around the world: retail, investing, banking, medical imaging and others.</p>
                    <p>I help business owners, entrepreneurs, founders and senior executives filter out the noise in AI
                        and
                        data science and invest only in truly profitable work, aligned with the existing company
                        strategy.
                        Through the definition of a data strategy, companies know what they should and what they
                        shouldn't
                        invest in when applying data science to their business.</p>
                    <p>Through my company, Enlightenment.ai, I provide a solution to the execution of the solutions to
                        these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>I have worked with various market leaders in Singapore, London, Denmark and Portugal. This was
                        only
                        possible because I was lucky enough to be invited to apply AI as a research scientist for top
                        research labs including MIT's Singapore lab - SMART, and CDV or amilab in Portugal, before
                        companies
                        were doing it.</p>

Technically, I lead a number of different analysis: identification of relevant events, identification of trends, anomaly detection, product recommendation, consumer behaviour analysis and churn analysis, to name a few."
